Part 1: modified part-1.c  

Part 2: modified part-2.c  

Part 3: For part 3 there were not many changes to make from part2's exec_file method, unmapping memory and running the file was removed and the method was made to return a pointer. The main method just goes through the steps layed out in the project description. all other methods are the same as the earlier parts. This overall leads to a very slim code with some reused code copy and pasted but otherwise very small changes made.
