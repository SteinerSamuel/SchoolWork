# Predicting Github Activity 
#### Senior Research 
GitHub is a social media platform for programmers to share code and help others develop software. Open source projects, projects in which users are free to see edit and share the code, have been increasing in popularity over the last couple of year and are the majority of projects shared on GitHub. Classification is a machine learning and statistical problem of trying to identify which sets of categories something falls into. Machine learning is a field of computer science which is concerned with creating systems which can improve without being explicitly programmed.  Many of the problems answered through machine learning classification can not be answered through other computational methods which is what makes them a powerful tool in solving many of todayâ€™s challenging questions. Machine learning has come a long way in developing strategies for creating classification models. Such methods as deep learning use large data sets to allow the system to discover the representation needed for classification instead describing the representation to the system.
