	"body": "1. [Breaking Changes] Simplified plugin API\n   - Removed Run/FollowUp functions\n   - Renamed Vocab to Keywords and VocabHandler to KeywordHandler, which better reflects their purposes\n   - Triggers are now automatically generated for the plugin based on Keywords\n   - Defining additional triggers beyond keywords (i.e. to route to your state machine, but not any keyword handler) is now optional and can be done using plugin.NewTrigger()\n   - Every plugin now has a state machine that's managed by Abot automatically\n     - You should use p.SM to access a pre-configured state machine, rather than building your own.\n   - Moved Memory API from the state machine to plugins to better reflect the relationship between memory and the plugin (memory belongs to plugins -- the state machine has nothing to do with\n     it.)\n     - Now use p.GetMemory() and p.SetMemory()\n   - Branching conversations are still supported\n     - Use p.SetBranches(func(in *dt.Msg) []dt.State) to use\n       branching conversations. Change the returned []dt.State based\n       on flags set in memory or by the *dt.Msg passed in. Abot will set the flags on a per-user, per-message basis based upon the return of this function. By default, this does not have to be implemented.\n2. Fixed a large number of state machine bugs\n3. Added support for routing to plugins and keyword handlers based on trained\n   Intents\n\nYou can see an example implementation of the latest changes at https://github.com/egtann/plugin_weather. Docs will follow.\n",

	"body": "allowing an optional argument to specify the database connection\nparameters allows different connection methods to be used. additionally,\nalong with some script refactoring, it allows the database to be setup\nseparately from the abot server.\n\nto support this, cmd/setup.sh was refactored into the following scripts:\n- cmd/setup.sh\n- cmd/dbsetup.sh\n- cmd/helper_functions.sh\n\ncmd/setup.sh now accepts an optional argument for the database\nconnection parameters. if no argument is given, it assumes sane\ndefaults. in both cases, the database parameters are saved in abot.env\nunder ABOT_DATABASE_URL. during setup, if the psql binary is\nunavailable, the script will skip the database setup. it assumes it was\nhandled externally. otherwise, cmd/dbsetup.sh is called with the same\nconnection argument (if any) that this script was called with. beyond\nthat, code was refactored into cmd/dbsetup.sh and\ncmd/helper_functions.sh and some general cleanup performed.\n\ncmd/dbsetup.sh contains all the logic for setting up the abot databases.\nit also accepts the same optional argument as cmd/setup.sh. this allows\nthe database to be setup on a different machine than the abot server.\nthis script now encapsulates the dependency on the psql binary.\n\ncmd/helper_functions.sh contains functions that help with running setup\ncommands, pretty printing messages, and database parameter parsing. this\nallows code re-use between cmd/setup.sh and cmd/dbsetup.sh, which may be\ncalled independently.\n\nthe following changes were made to the go code-base:\n\nabot.go:loadEnvVars() is now in core/boot.go:LoadEnvVars(). since the\ndatabase connection relies on the ABOT_DATABASE_URL environment\nvariable, this function needs to be available for plugins/external\npackages.\n\ncore/boot.go:ConnectDB() now uses the ABOT_DATABASE_URL environment\nvariable exclusively. if ABOT_DATABASE_URL is empty, it applies\ndefaults.\n\nshared/plugin/plugin.go:connectDB() is gone. now it uses the code in\ncore/boot.go:ConnectDB()\n",

	"body": "allowing an optional argument to specify the database connection\nparameters allows different connection methods to be used. additionally,\nalong with some script refactoring, it allows the database to be setup\nseparately from the abot server.\n\nto support this, cmd/setup.sh was refactored into the following scripts:\n- cmd/setup.sh\n- cmd/dbsetup.sh\n- cmd/helper_functions.sh\n\ncmd/setup.sh now accepts an optional argument for the database\nconnection parameters. if no argument is given, it assumes sane\ndefaults. in both cases, the database parameters are saved in abot.env\nunder ABOT_DATABASE_URL. during setup, if the psql binary is\nunavailable, the script will skip the database setup. it assumes it was\nhandled externally. otherwise, cmd/dbsetup.sh is called with the same\nconnection argument (if any) that this script was called with. beyond\nthat, code was refactored into cmd/dbsetup.sh and\ncmd/helper_functions.sh and some general cleanup performed.\n\ncmd/dbsetup.sh contains all the logic for setting up the abot databases.\nit also accepts the same optional argument as cmd/setup.sh. this allows\nthe database to be setup on a different machine than the abot server.\nthis script now encapsulates the dependency on the psql binary.\n\ncmd/helper_functions.sh contains functions that help with running setup\ncommands, pretty printing messages, and database parameter parsing. this\nallows code re-use between cmd/setup.sh and cmd/dbsetup.sh, which may be\ncalled independently.\n\nthe following changes were made to the go code-base:\n\nabot.go:loadEnvVars() is now in core/boot.go:LoadEnvVars(). since the\ndatabase connection relies on the ABOT_DATABASE_URL environment\nvariable, this function needs to be available for plugins/external\npackages.\n\ncore/boot.go:ConnectDB() now uses the ABOT_DATABASE_URL environment\nvariable exclusively. if ABOT_DATABASE_URL is empty, it applies\ndefaults.\n\nshared/plugin/plugin.go:connectDB() is gone. now it uses the code in\ncore/boot.go:ConnectDB()\n",

	"body": "### Preface\n\nHi,\n\nFirst and foremost: Apologies if this isn't the correct workflow for opening a pull request. The contributing page made it seem like this was an appropriate way to make relatively minor contributions, but if there are steps I should've taken first (like posting on the mailing list), I can absolutely do that and close this.\n### Update to the `tr` call in the setup script\n\nI'm proposing a couple of changes to the `tr` call in the setup script: One enhancement and one small fix for users trying to run the setup script on OS X (I'm running 10.11.3, but I imagine it affects previous OS X versions as well).\n1. Use [:alnum:] instead of enumerating the characters. Also add a small subset of punctuation characters that won't cause horrible problems, but allow a slightly larger universe of characters to create the secret from.\n2. Set `LC_CTYPE`. In OS X, at least, `tr` will fail miserably when reading from `/dev/urandom`. I suppose this is probably because `tr` encounters non-UTF sequences in `/dev/urandom` and then bails out. I don't think this change will affect other OSes, but I could certainly wrap this in an `$OSTYPE` check if it eases anyone's mind.\n### Update the README\n\nThis is explained in the commit, but I think the README should say `source cmd/setup.sh` instead of just `cmd/setup.sh`\n",
