New records will get merged when back online.\n\nAlso I use storm as a nice wrapper on top of boltdb. It very easy.\n\nPerformance wise it's also very fast in reads.\n\nAnyway, enough said about it.

	"body": "The current workflow for Abot is a bit of a pain. Abot's designed to work with plugins, so you don't need to modify the internals, but all of `/core` and `/shared` are still included with every Abot. Running multiple Abot projects on the same machine is tough.\n\nTo fix this, we're replacing the Abot CLI tool to be similar to the best parts of working with Rails and NPM/Node. If you've used either of those, you'll be right at home.\n\nNow you'll install Abot on your computer via `go get`, then you'll be able to create new projects. Rebuilding the project no longer rebuilds the `abot` binary--just your project. This means that if something goes wrong, the `abot` command will keep working. There's also much easier plugin testing as well, which will enable us to automate plugin integration tests on itsabot.org without complex contain plugin integration tests on itsabot.org without complex containerization and security measures.\n\nI've written a guide on the new plugin CLI here: https://github.com/itsabot/abot/wiki/Understanding-the-CLI\n"

Instead of using `os.Getenv`, plugins must now use `p.GetSetting()`. Those settings must also be declared in your plugin.json per the updated spec: https://github.com/itsabot/abot/wiki/plugin.json-Spec\n\nWith this change, you'll be able to edit plugin-specific variables via the admin panel (like API keys), and itsabot.org can provide more helpful (and complete) install instructions.\n"

	"body": "We'd like to show how user authentication works with existing user databases. You should be able to provide a consistent user experience to your users (remembering their names, shipping addresses, etc.) as they switch from messaging Abot on SMS to Facebook Messenger, email, or any other service.\n\nThe challenge is that user identifiers across platforms like Telegram, SMS & Facebook differ. e.g. SMS uses phone number, and Telegram uses username or user id. To identify the same user across these different services takes some customization.\n\nWe'd like some guides in markdown format detailing sample authentication flows across SMS, email, and webhooks (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Telegram, etc.) to be added to the wiki.\n\nFor example, a guide for an SMS authentication flow might look like this:\n1. SMS that user a link to your website and ask that he/she logs in. (include sample code. this would probably be handled in a state with SkipIfComplete. The Complete check would confirm that HasMemory(\"authenticated\"))\n2. On your server, when he logs in:\n   - Save the SMS phone number from the user.\n   - Send a text message back from Abot's phone number to get the user back in the SMS flow. \"Thanks for logging in! How can I help you today?\"\n3. Write a plugin that listens for the `PostProcessing` event. In that event, make a GET request to your server to confirm if that phone number is currently authenticated. If so, `SetMemory(\"authenticated\", true)`, or `DeleteMemory(\"authenticated\")` if not.\n\nIt's then up to your server to decide when the user is no longer authenticated. Should it time out after 30 minutes? 12 hours? 2 weeks? Should it require authentication each time an important transaction is performed, such as a purchase?\n"

Here's a WIP screenshot.\n\nGoals of mine are to:\n- Help you stay up-to-date, ensuring you're running the latest Abot version\n- Help you set up your Abot completely with all the new functionality that's being added (Account Connect, etc.), as well as surface that new functionality after each update\n- Showcase the plugins you've installed and connect you to find more\n- Show basic usage stats (with support later for graphs/visualizations)\n\nI'd love any feedback. Right now it's just front-end work, so it's all still pretty flexible.\n\n![Admin Dashboard](http://i.imgur.com/k7uNOkP.png)\n"

	"body": "1. [Breaking Changes] Simplified plugin API\n   - Removed Run/FollowUp functions\n   - Renamed Vocab to Keywords and VocabHandler to KeywordHandler, which better reflects their purposes\n   - Triggers are now automatically generated for the plugin based on Keywords\n   - Defining additional triggers beyond keywords (i.e. to route to your state machine, but not any keyword handler) is now optional and can be done using plugin.NewTrigger()\n   - Every plugin now has a state machine that's managed by Abot automatically\n     - You should use p.SM to access a pre-configured state machine, rather than building your own.\n   - Moved Memory API from the state machine to plugins to better reflect the relationship between memory and the plugin (memory belongs to plugins -- the state machine has nothing to do with\n     it.)\n     - Now use p.GetMemory() and p.SetMemory()\n   - Branching conversations are still supported\n     - Use p.SetBranches(func(in *dt.Msg) []dt.State) to use\n       branching conversations. Change the returned []dt.State based\n       on flags set in memory or by the *dt.Msg passed in. Abot will set the flags on a per-user, per-message basis based upon the return of this function. By default, this does not have to be implemented.\n2. Fixed a large number of state machine bugs\n3. Added support for routing to plugins and keyword handlers based on trained\n   Intents\n\nYou can see an example implementation of the latest changes at https://github.com/egtann/plugin_weather. Docs will follow.\n"

	"body": "I can publish a plugin on behalf of another user. This is not a desirable behavior.\n\nTo combat this, we'll add a required \"Maintainer\" key on `plugin.json` which must have the itsabot.org registered email you intend to publish plugins under. It's similar to how some services require DNS changes to demonstrate proof-of-ownership over a domain. Just like that, we'll require you to set a verifiable value in something that only you (or people to whom you give access) can control. Instead of DNS, it's your plugin.json.\n\nThis is susceptible to another attack, though, where I register on itsabot.org with an email that's not mine, but one that matches a known Maintainer email, so it'll allow falsely publishing a plugin under that email. To solve that, we'll have to implement email verification from itsabot.org to prove ownership over the email.\n\nWith these two steps, we can verify that you own the plugin you're publishing!\n"

That is, I train the `alarm` and `restaurants` plugins separately.\n- Training data of published plugins must be shared to enable those plugins to work. I'm thinking of supporting two models simultaneously:\n  1. Encode training data into a text file and save it with the plugin (open-source trained model)\n  2. Make it available via an external HTTP request (closed-source trained model). This will enable developers to charge money or protect particularly complex trained models.\n- The Intent mentioned here would be available to plugins via StructuredInput.\n- Over time we can expand this design with:\n  - In-line testing, so you can quickly iterate without jumping back to the console, perhaps via a keyboard shortcut.\n  - The ability to add additional, custom fields beyond Intent.\n  - Auto-completion on the field (set_alarm, disable_alarm, etc.) with past values.\n  - Display real user requests to that plugin, with requests that the plugin couldn't handle sorted to the top.\n\nWould love feedback!\n"

I noticed that there is a `SkipIfComplete`, but using it seems wrong.\n\nFor example, I want to support the following homogeneously:\n- What's the weather in Seattle?\n  - bot: The weather is 55 degrees and cloudy.\n- What's the weather?\n  - bot: What city do you want the weather for?\n  - me: Seattle\n  - bot: The weather is 55 degrees and cloudy.\n\nWhat I'm inclined to do is just to use `SkipIfComplete` and do all the logic within `Complete()`.

	"body": "### Preface\n\nHi,\n\nFirst and foremost: Apologies if this isn't the correct workflow for opening a pull request. The contributing page made it seem like this was an appropriate way to make relatively minor contributions, but if there are steps I should've taken first (like posting on the mailing list), I can absolutely do that and close this.\n### Update to the `tr` call in the setup script\n\nI'm proposing a couple of changes to the `tr` call in the setup script: One enhancement and one small fix for users trying to run the setup script on OS X (I'm running 10.11.3, but I imagine it affects previous OS X versions as well).\n1. Use [:alnum:] instead of enumerating the characters. Also add a small subset of punctuation characters that won't cause horrible problems, but allow a slightly larger universe of characters to create the secret from.\n2. Set `LC_CTYPE`. In OS X, at least, `tr` will fail miserably when reading from `/dev/urandom`. I suppose this is probably because `tr` encounters non-UTF sequences in `/dev/urandom` and then bails out. I don't think this change will affect other OSes, but I could certainly wrap this in an `$OSTYPE` check if it eases anyone's mind.\n### Update the README\n\nThis is explained in the commit, but I think the README should say `source cmd/setup.sh` instead of just `cmd/setup.sh`\n"
