# Flask Tutorial 1: Web Framework & Creating a Flask Application
The purpose of this tutorial is to go over the core ideas of FLASK. This tutorial will go over the following:
1. generate a web page with input data to your application,
2. run the application to perform mathematical computations, and
3. generate a web page with the results of the computations.

## The MVC pattern
This tutorial explores the idea of the Model-View-Controller pattern through FLASK. The MVC pattern introduces:

- the model to hold the data
- the view to display the data
- the controller to move the data by gluing the model and the view.

The tutorial creates a simple program which takes in an argument and returns the sin() of that argument.
