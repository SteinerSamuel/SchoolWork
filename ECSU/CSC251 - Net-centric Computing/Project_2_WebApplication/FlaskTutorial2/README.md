# Flask Tutorial 2: Creating a Flask Application
The purpose of this tutorial is to showcase how to create a basic Flask application.  This is an extension of tutorial 1.
This handles the view as one template file instead of two. This is done to simplify the view part of the MVC pattern. 
Later in [Tutorial 3](../FlaskTutorial3) we will further seperate the controller into a model and controller. This is to
fully make use of the MVC pattern.
